# smallest_multiple
The function returns a uint64, the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n where n is a positive integer scalar. If the result would be greater than what can be represented as a uint64, the function returns 0. For example, 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
